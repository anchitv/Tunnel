# Tunnel
Code written as part of COMP9021

The code performs the following tasks :- 

* The program prompts the user to input a file name. If there is no file with that name in the working directory, then the program outputs an error message and exits.

* The contents of the file should consist of exactly two lines with the same number of at last two (positive or negative) integers. Consecutive numbers are separated by at least one space, and there can be extra spaces, including empty lines, anywhere. Also, the i-th number of the first sequence should be strictly greater than the i-th number of the second sequence because at any point in the tunnel, the ceiling is above the floor. If that is not the case then the program outputs another error message and exits.

* The program then outputs:
  - the distance over which one can see into the tunnel when looking outside the tunnel from the West;
  - the maximum distance over which one can see into the tunnel when being inside the tunnel.
